# OnlineFoodDeliveryServicesWebsites
This is the  Online Food Delivery Service website from the web development course by Anshika0306.

For this website I use HTML and CSS, in HTML I made different sections  and div and inside the section i use different Id's and classes , and utility classes also, Id's like like logo, home, services, client-section, contact, clients, And classes like navbar, item, h-primary, btn, box, center, h-secondary-center, h-primary-center, client-item, form-group. And use footer also.

By using CSS we made two folders  first one is "style.css" for styling the different sections used in HTML giving background-color, color, margin, padding, height, width, font-style , font size, font-weight, display-flex, justify-content, align-item, scroll-behavior, position, z-index , opacity, font-family, text-decoration, border, border-radius, list-style,  flex-direction, background. And second one is "phone.css" used for create responsive website.
we use different images for background and symbols.
